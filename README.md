RemitSaver 💸🌍

Transparent remittances + Stablecoin POS for El Salvador
Built at Cerebral Valley AI Fintech Hackathon NYC, August 2025

🚀 What It Does

RemitSaver helps families and small merchants in El Salvador save money on remittances and payments:
	1.	Fee & FX Comparator – Quickly compare flat fees, % fees, and FX markups between two providers to see who delivers the most money to the recipient.
	2.	Stablecoin Point-of-Sale (POS) – Merchants can generate a USDC (Polygon) QR code for any sale, so customers can pay in stablecoins with near-zero fees.

	3.	(FUTURE)Bilingual Helper Agent (EN/ES) – An AI-style assistant that explains remittance options, ID requirements, and POS setup in plain English or Spanish.

⸻

🌟 Why It Matters
	•	Remittance costs are high: Salvadorans abroad send billions back home each year, but fees eat up to 6–8%.
	•	Merchants face high card fees: credit card transactions cost 2–3% + $0.30.
	•	Stablecoins solve both: USDC on Polygon settles in seconds with fees measured in cents.

👉 With RemitSaver, families receive more, merchants keep more, and adoption is easier thanks to clear comparisons and QR POS.

Try it:
	•	Adjust amounts + fees in the comparator.
	•	Enter a Polygon address in Accept USDC (Polygon) and generate a QR code.
	•	Scan the QR with a crypto wallet (works with “Plain address” mode).
	•	Ask the helper agent questions in English or Spanish.

🛠️ How It Works
	•	Frontend: HTML + vanilla JS, hosted on GitHub Pages.
	•	QR Codes: Generated using qrcode.js.
	•	Stablecoin: Native USDC contract on Polygon PoS.
	•	Agent (future): Powered by LangChain backend with tools for FX rates and Polygon transaction checks.

📅 Roadmap
	•	✅ MVP: Manual comparator, POS QR, bilingual helper.
	•	🔜 Live FX API integration.
	•	🔜 Payment confirmation via Polygonscan/Alchemy API.
	•	🔜 Pilot with Salvadoran merchants to validate usability.
